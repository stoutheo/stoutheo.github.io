      Human-Robot Interaction - Optimal Control - Robot Learning -
      Manipulation<br />
  </p>

  Theo envisions a future where robots co-exist with humans and naturally augment
  humans capabilities. He ventures to develop the required theory towards
  demonstrating Dyadic collaborative Manipulation (DcM) scenarios between a human and a robot.
  In such a scenario, a robot agent can collaborate with a human,
  as naturally as two humans would do. His scientific focus is on-line motion planning
  algorithms based on numerical optimal control theory and machine learning models that can
  be used to learn and predict physical interaction models between the individuals of a dyad, as well as
  between an individual and an object.
  Further, his is also very keen on investigating both optimal control and logical planning
  methods that allow the blending of multiple optimal elementary policies into emergent
  complex policies. He believes that the key for the robots to attain complex behaviours is;
  to construct complex policies from elemetary ones.

  ##### Main scientific domains: #####

  + Optimal Control

  + Hybrid Systems

  + Learning to predict human intentions through physical interactions

  + Decoding multi-task behaviours


  #### Bio: ####

  His first experience in robotics research was during his diploma thesis 2011 at the University of
  Patras, under the supervision of
  [Prof. Antony Tzes](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/anthony-tzes.html).
  Theo explored sampling based methods, specifically Particle Filters towards adressing the SLAM problem
  for a mobile ground robot. Being fascinated from his first experience in the field, in January 2012
  he moved abroad and joined the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics at the German Aerospace Center
  (DLR). At DLR he primarily worked with [Dr. MÃ¡ximo Roa](https://rmc.dlr.de/rm/de/staff/maximo.roa/)
  and numerous other great colleagues on grasp planning, dynamic grasp simulations, physics engines
  and software development. During this period he got familiar with many robotic areas, co-published
  a number of papers and actively participated in two European projects, namely
  [SMErobotics](http://www.smerobotics.org) and [EUROC](http://www.euroc-project.eu).
  Driven by his belief that learning is the key towards developing truly intelligent robots.
  In September 2015 he decided to enhance his education on Machine Learning and Intelligent Robotics,
  joining the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. His MSc thesis was on
  the interdisciplinary area of bio-robotics, were under the supervision of
  [Prof. Barbara Webb](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bwebb/). During his thesis he developed an
  onmi-directional robot with 360-degrees vision, that immitates the behaviour of fiddler crabs
  under predation. During his MSc he also had the luck to get to know
  [Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/svijayak/),
  and enrol at the [Edinburgh Centre for Robotics (ECR)](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org) in
  September 2016 as a PhD student, under [Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar's](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/svijayak/) and
  [Dr.Michael Gienger's](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=oU2jyxMAAAAJ&hl=de) supervision.
  His currently pursuing his PhD studies, which are funded by the Honda Research Institute Europe.
